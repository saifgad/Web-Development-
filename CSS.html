                <h2>Grid vs Flexbox</h2> 
            
                Grid is two dimensional, while Flex is one<br>
                Grid is layout first, while Flexbox is content first<br>
                Flex is for components of an app, Grid is for the app layout itself<br>
                CSS Grid does not replace Flexbox. Each can achieve things that the other is not capable of, and in fact, a true master can use Flexbox and CSS Grid together in harmony to create the ultimate webpage layout.<br>
                At the highest level CSS Grid excels at creating layouts for a webpage, while Flexbox is a master of content flow for each element that makes up the page layout.<br>
